** Configuration

*** Ignored Functions

By default, =setUp= and =tearDown= methods are excluded from the function list. Customize this with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ivy-phpunit-ignorelist '("setUp" "tearDown" "setUpBeforeClass"))
#+END_SRC

To show all functions, set an empty list:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ivy-phpunit-ignorelist '())
#+END_SRC
